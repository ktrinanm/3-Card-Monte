# 3-Card-Monte

This game is based off of an old hustler's game, but it's a little more honest.

The menu opens, where the player can read the instructions, start a new game, double or nothing, or exit. The double or nothing option at this stage will assume that the player has already lost a round. 

After starting a new game, the player picks a card. If it's the Queen, he wins, if not, he loses. During the next round, the correct amount of money is subtracted from the player's and dealer's "pockets" for the next pot, reflecting who won the last round.
